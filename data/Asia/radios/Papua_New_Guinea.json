The functions of the Corporation are to:\n…provide balanced, objective and impartial broadcasting services within and, if so directed by the Head of State, acting on advice, outside the country, and in so doing to take, in the interests of the community, all such measures as, in the opinion of the Corporation, are conducive to the full development of suitable broadcasting programs.\nTo link with its audience, the NBC has two main services: Karai National Radio,operating nationally on short wave (SW), and on AM and FM in the National Capital District,and Kundu Radio Services ,operating in the 19 provincial centres around PNG.\nKarai National Radio broadcasts from 5 Mile in the National Capital District. The format is aimed at the mature audience, and provides radio programs and music for all ages, including talk shows, live broadcasts, primary school broadcasts, news, sports, and weather reports.\nKarai National Radio is both a national and international radio station covering all of PNG and, via its SW frequencies, the world. Our FM frequency (90.7) covers the National Capital District while the AM and SW services take our programs to every village in PNG. The advantage of three band frequencies is that the service is able to disseminate news, information and entertainment all over the country.\nKarai National Radio started broadcasting in 1974 and for a long time was the only electronic media in PNG providing news, information and entertainment. The service gained a huge audience in PNG and the South Pacific.\nAfter a decade of public service broadcasting Karai National Radio was corporatised by a government statute in 1980. Business can now tap into the huge market NBC had built over the years. Now, there are many other radio services on various FM bands throughout the country, but NBC is still the only national station able to reach all areas of PNG via its SW and AM broadcasts.\nKarai National Radio is proud to remain the dominant broadcaster on the national airwaves with educational, informative, and entertaining broadcasting. Being responsible for the creation and development of the media market for over 30 years, Karai National Radio is committed to excellence, innovation and creativity. It ensures both advertisers and listeners enjoy supporting the national broadcaster."
