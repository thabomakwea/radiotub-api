Jesus is coming again very soon are you ready for his second coming?\n\nBehold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him... Rev 1:7\n\n   How we start\n\nSecond Advent Radio Ministry was first started by Sis Maple Lake, a God fearing woman of God who believe that Jesus is coming again,\n\nBecause of her love for God and the work that God has laid upon her heart and on his people to take to the world. Second Advent radio Ministry started small in her home and then she branch out building a studio in her own yard where she is presently operating. God work sometimes starts small but will grow by the leading of the Holy Spirit. Day by day God is leading us to higher heights in radio broadcasting. Second Advent Radio Ministry is owned and operated by Miss Maple Lake (General Manager) she is married to Mr. Alfred Lake of Gunthropes."

Antigua, a 9- by 12-mile tropical island, is ideally situated at the center of the Eastern Caribbean chain of islands known as the Lesser Antilles. In 1973 and 1974 the three missionaries who were to be instrumental in the establishment of the station moved to Antigua. They were Al Snyder, manager, Rolen Cornelius, assistant manager, and Curtis Waite, engineer. The Lord miraculously brought in the funds needed to build the station, and, with the help of many volunteers, the Caribbean Radio Lighthouse began broadcasting on September 7, 1975.The name \"Radio Lighthouse\" was chosen for the spiritual analogy of the work of a lighthouse. Just as the light of a lighthouse warns of dangers to mariners, or guides them to a safe harbor, so the light of God's word, broadcast from CRL, guides the lost to safe harbor in Jesus Christ, and warns the Christian of spiritual rocks and shoals."

My love for broadcasting led me to begin a religious programme on several Christian radio stations.\n \nAfter marrying my wife Michal, I shared my desire with her and she was also excited about it. One Saturday I had a microphone that was borrowed from Brother Wesley Beazer to do my broadcast. My wife and I used that microphone and pretended to be reporting at a radio station, we were very excited. Little did we know that this was the start of our mission. God was using what we termed as foolishness to speak to us.\n \nWe realized that this desire was to become a reality, so we applied for a radio broadcasting license. The road to acquiring the license was not easy. Many times we wanted to quit, but God's mercy kept us. Finally, on the 20th June 2001, after numerous calls to the relevant authorities, our application was approved and we were given a license to operate on the FM frequency of 103.1 MHz.\n\nOn Saturday 8 September 2001, after a sleepless night in Antigua with our technician Brother Trevor, I travelled to Barbuda. On arrival I quickly called Brothers Jason and Wesley and informed them that I had obtained a transmitter. At about 7.15 PM it all happened. The Abundant Life Radio was on the air! New life came to Barbuda with the song \"Jesus and Me\" from the Regenerated Singers. We called around the village and asked persons to tune in. We continued testing for a week with assistance from Brother Neil George, who began the programming every morning at 5.30 am and brother Agel Cochrane who sis the afternoon programming.\n \n“Hitherto Hath the Lord helped us”. Certainly we have achieved much since the inception in 2001.\n \nOne of our Greatest Achievements came in January 2006 when our Website coverage to the world was launched. So far we have had responses from people on every continent of the world. We are touching the world from Barbuda. We have also improved coverage and quality of broadcasting on both of our Frequencies.\n \nThere have been a tremendous number of testimonies of the breakthrough, deliverances and the salvation of listeners to this station.\n \nWe serve an Unlimited God and so we put no limits on what we can do for him. Our next project is to construct a “State of the Art” Studio in Barbuda. Our main aim is to win many souls for the kingdom Of God."
