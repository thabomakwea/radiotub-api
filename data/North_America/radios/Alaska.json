KSKA signed on the air as 103 FM on August 15 as Aurora Community Broadcasting with 3,000 watts of power.\n\nAround 1980, KSKA boosted power to 36,000 watts and moved to FM 91.1 on the dial. In 1994, KSKA merged with public television station KAKM Channel 7, forming the parent company of the Alaska Public Telecommunications Inc. (APTI) and moved in with KAKM at the Elmo Sackett Broadcast Center in 1997.\n\nKSKA tripled its coverage area in the fall of 1998 by installing a 100,000-watt transmitter. On July 1, 2004, APTI merged with the Alaska Public Radio Network (APRN) to become more efficient by consolidating services.\n\nKSKA broadcasts 24-hours-a-day and reaches about 60 percent of the state’s population. KSKA cooperates with KAKM in local initiatives and public affairs programming and APRN provides news content and direction for KSKA reporters and public affairs producers.\n\n------\nShows: A Prairie Home Companion, All Things Considered, Beale Street Caravan, Car Talk (NPR), Fresh Air (NPR), Latino USA, Marketplace, NPR's Morning Edition, On the Media, Piano Jazz, Riverwalk Jazz, Talk of the Nation, Talk of the Nation Science Friday, The Thistle & Shamrock, This American Life, Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me, Weekend All Things Considered, Weekend Edition Saturday, Weekend Edition Sunday, Global Business, One Planet, The Strand, BBC World Business News, Calling All Pets, Heart and Soul, The Interview, The World Today, World Briefing, Jazz Profiles, Blues Before Sunrise, The World, Tech Nation, Mountain Stage, Afropop Worldwide, Alternative Radio, City Arts and Lectures, Jazz Set, Only a Game, National Native News, Alaska News Nightly, Talk of Alaska\n\n-----\nHosts: Michele Norris, Robert Siegel, Melissa Block, Ruthie Foster, Betty Harris, Bill Frisell, Tom Magliozzi, Ray Magliozzi, Kai Ryssdal, Steve Chiotakis, Jeremy Hobson, Renee Montagne, Steve Inskeep, Dorothy Hickson, Carlos Rosado, Richard Knox, Not Found, David Holt, Jim Cullum, Neal Conan, Ira Flatow, Annette Heist, Charles Bergquist, Ira Glass, Jessica Hopper, Alex Blumberg, Peter Sagal Sagal, Carl Kasell Kasell, Guy Raz, Scott Simon, Audie Cornish, Robin Guthrie, Brendan Perry, Marcelo D2, Terry Gross, Lisa Mullins, Marco Werman, Moira Gunn, David Ewing Duncan, Larry Groce, Paul Lancour, Steven Winn, Kim Severson, Bill Littlefield, Charlie Pierce"

            "rest": "on in 1976. KVOK went off the air for about a month around August 1977. KVOK returned to the air in September after AFRN reduced power to 50 watts. KVOK is still on the air, but from a different transmitter site, at Buskin Lake, on a rented USCG tower. Originally it was on a 150 foot tower located right behind the Southern Alaska Forwarding warehouse which is behind Mimi's Deli. The original antenna was quite unique. There were about 12 toploading wires extending from the top of the tower almost to the ground. There was another set of 12 wires, insulated from the tower, extending from a point about ten feet above ground directly horizontally to convenient trees around the perimeter. This above-ground counterpoise was fed from a tap just a little bit above ground in the tuner.\n\nI found a group of photos I took from the top of the tower just before I took it down in late 1993, but they were all of the view from there and only one showed any tower. The neighborhood has certainly grown up since then! I have a number of artifacts from the site. The old tower is near Homer, on the ground.\n\nYou'll notice, since I'm a broadcast engineer that I put the transmitter first in this story. Well, the studio was in several locations. Today it's at 1315 Mill Bay Road in Jim Ashford's building. Just before this location it was at 1227 Mill Bay Road. Before that it was in Kashevaroff Villa, and before that it was at the Kodiak Inn.\n\nBob Bridges's dad originally built the station. Here's an e-mail message from him.\n\n\n\n\nFrom: \"Dr. Bridges\"    alaskabob (at) RivRad.com\nSubject: Radio \nDate: Mon, 10 Aug 1998 18:49:17 -0700\n\nHello Joe:\n\nThanks for the e-mail.  It has been a very long time.  I was in Kodiak\nfor the first time three years ago and boy had things changed.  I heard\nthe the old site was being decommissioned and video taped the site.\nWhen I cut down those 3 plus acres of forest there wasn't a road near\nby.  Peter Bailey helped on a few days back then in the summer of 1974.\n\nOur history on Kodiak goes back to 1967 when my Dad was finishing the\nconstruction of KSRM in Soldotna.  We happened to meet some Kodiak\npeople at the time and they told us of the need for a station on Kodiak.\nSo, I should be able to fill in the 1967 to 1979 era.  \n\nWhen I visited KVOK three years ago, very little was left from the\noriginal gear.  Only one Revox was identifiable.  Thanks for letting me\nknow that some of the gear \"lives on\". The  top-loadedcounterpoised\nantenna that Carl E. Smith designed was very good.  The FCC had fits\nover approving it but we got it done.  I will be glad to submit a\nhistory for the KMXT site as one central repository of information is a\ngood start.  \n\nThere are issues that never have seen the light of day, that had a major\ninfluence on the operation of KVOK, and the relations (sometimes\nstrained) with the Coast Guard, AFRN and KMXT.   They are purely\nhistorical now, but are worth putting in perpective.  \n\nPresently I am a partner in a nine member radiology group in Riverside.\nWe have three imaging centers, and have the contract for the major\nhospital here.  Prior to Riverside I was an Assistant Professor at\nUniversity of California - Irvine School of Medicine.   I am double\nboarded with certification in Radiology and Nuclear Medicine.  Kind of\nfar removed from radio these days.. but I hope to get back into Alaska\ndoing locum tenens.  Looking forward to saying \"hi\" personally.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBob Bridges"
