Certain broadcasts also air with video at www.WHAV.TV.\n\nThe earliest use of the WHAV call was July 22, 1922 in Wilmington, Del. It was one of the first 100 broadcast radio stations licensed in the US and changed to WDEL in 1926. Later, the Haverhill, Mass. Police Department began using the call letters for its shortwave radio station.\n\nThe call’s entrance locally was conceived during World War II in the offices of The Haverhill Gazette, a daily newspaper serving what was, in the middle of the century, a shoe-manufacturing center 30 miles (48 km) north of Boston. The Gazette, as early as 1944, planned an FM radio station, but had to wait for the end of wartime controls on new construction.\n\nIn response to comments by Haverhill Mayor Albert W. Glynn, Gazette Publisher John T. Russ announced on April 14, 1945, “The Gazette long ago recognized the need of a Haverhill radio station and has long been in agreement with your premise that a newspaper is the logical proprietor of a broadcasting service, especially because the dissemination of news is the primary task of both press and radio.”"

            "rest": "network of five public radio stations in Boston, Worcester, Falmouth, Orleans and Newburyport Massachusetts. The Boston, Worcester and Falmouth stations all broadcast on 91.9FM. The Newburyport station can be heard on 91.7FM, and the Orleans station can be heard on 1170AM. All five facilities simulcast the identical program schedule, which is produced from our studios located at the UMass Boston Campus. The station's 24 hour a day broadcast schedule reaches tens of thousands of listeners in over 275 cities and towns in eastern and central Massachusetts and Cape Cod along with parts of Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Connecticut. A webcast of our signal can also be heard, live, around the world through the internet, and we currently have listeners in all 50 states and in 103 countries.\n\nMission Statement: WUMB Radio is dedicated to produce, acquire, and disseminate high quality, diverse and valued public service radio programming to significant audiences. The radio station is committed to serving as a local and national resource for the cultivation, promotion and preservation of various genres of folk music through its radio programming and selected enterprises.\n\nThe Boston station, WUMB-FM, was the last station in the Metro- Boston area to be granted an FM license from the Federal Communications Commission. It went on the air in 1982 with an all- volunteer announcing staff, moving to a professional staff in 1986 when it became a public radio affiliate of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The station was the aspiration of a cadre of UMass Boston students in 1968, including its current General Manager Patricia Monteith, in what became a fourteen-year campaign to get the station on the air. The Worcester station, WBPR-FM, was purchased in 1993 from Worcester County Christian Broadcasting, which owned a permit to construct the station, but had never actually built it. The Falmouth station, WFPB-FM, was developed with the help of an expansion funding grant from CPB and went on the air in 1996. The Orleans station was a donation from GramCam Communications in 1998. And the Newburyport station was built with the help of a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2001.\n\nThere are over twenty-five people regularly working at WUMB-FM including full-time, part-time and manangement staff, student employees, interns and volunteers. On occasion, some UMass Boston students participate as part of the \"Radio Learning Project\", a year-long experiential learning program. Local area high school and college students receive credit from their affiliated internship programs. Community volunteers come from all walks of life and assist the station with programming, fundraising efforts and special events.\n\nWUMB-FM is committed to providing unique program offerings. It is the country's foremost radio station for folk and roots music, largely airing a mix including singer-songwriter, blues, Celtic, Americana, bluegrass and more. Weekends, the station is a cultural center for traditional folk and Celtic music, as well as blues, and world music. More than 250 musicians come in to WUMB-FM each year to play live for the station's listeners and provide insight about their music. Public affairs, public service and news programs are blended throughout the entire schedule for a comprehensive educational experience.\n\nWUMB also operates 2 one-week summer music camps, 3-hour guitar clinics each quarter, and is actively involved in several community engagement projects throughout the year including the NEA-funded Big Read initiative.\n\n------\nShows: Beale Street Caravan, Humankind, Latino USA, Midnight Special, Tent Show Radio, Grateful Dead Hour, World Cafe, American Routes, Etown, WoodSongs Old-time Radio Hour, Mountain Stage, Women in Music, Art of the Song, Brazilian Hour, Commonwealth Journal (WUMB), Acoustic Sunrise (WUMB), Celtic Twilight, Downeast Ceilidh, Folk Odyssey, Folk Scene, Guest Mix, Highway 61 Revisited (WUMB), Live at Noon, Member Concert, Morning Express, Music Mix (WUMB), Traditional Folk\n\n-----\nHosts: Ruthie Foster, Betty Harris, Bill Frisell, David Freudberg, Michael Perry, David Gans, Dennis Coffey, Lloyd Cole, Steve Miller, Nick Spitzer, Maureen Loughran, Kaori Maeyama, Nick Forster, Helen Forster, Dorothy Edwards, Joe Conkwright, Roger Duvall, Larry Groce, Viv Nesbitt, John Dillon, Lisa Joyce, Janis Pryor, Dick Pleasants, Marcia Palmater, Dana Westover, Bruce Davis, Guest Mix, Albert O, Jay Moberg, Dave Palmater, Patty Domeniconi, Anita Lee, Gail Gilmore"

            "rest": "e company is made up of three partners, Carl Strube, Peter Falconi and Bob Couture.  Both Strube and Falconi have extensive backgrounds in the broadcating industry.  Their stories are told below.  Bob Couture is a successful, local businessman.  There is a lot of history behind WNBP and some of it is covered on this page.\n\nWNBP signed on the air in 1957 as a daytime only station at 1470 AM, owned by Puritan Broadcasting of Lynn Massachusetts. In 1982 the station moved to 1450 on the dial, added nighttime operation and changed call letters to WCEA. In 1987 the call letters were changed to WNCG and finally returned to WNBP in 1991.\n\nThere were a few different owners of WNBP throughout 70's, 80's and 90's.  None made a bigger impact on WNBP than Radio Newburyport, LLC owned by Newbury native Robert \"Doc\" Fuller. Fuller along with partner J.J. Jeffries owned several other stations under their company name Fuller-Jeffries Broadcasting. In 1998 WNBP was a sole venture of Fuller with his longtime friend Al Mozier as General Manager.  WNBP held a special spot in Fuller's heart.  Bob was one of the very first disc-jockeys on the station when it originally signed-on 1957. After a tremendously successful career in national radio ownership and management, \"Doc\" Fuller was truly home again with his purchase of WNBP.  From 1998 to 2001, many improvements to the station were made by Fuller and Mozier including purchasing all new studio equipment, a new transmitter and installing a new tower and ground system at the transmitter site on Ferry Road in Salisbury.\n\nIn September 2004, Fuller announced a deal had been reached to sell WNBP to Westport Communications. At the time of the sale, Westport Communications owned one other station, WBOQ-FM, Northshore 104.9. WNBP's studios were relocated to Beverly at the site of Westport's FM station. \n\nIn March of 2009 WNBP was sold by Westport Communications to it's current owners, Port Broadcasting, LLC.  The station began broadcasting from it's new downtown Newburyport studios on March 13.  The managing partners of Port Broadcasting knew the first order of business was to bring WNBP back to it's home... Newburyport.\n\nPort Broadcasting's Carl Strube began his radio career in Maine when he was still in grade school.  In fact, with his father's help, Carl started broadcasting from his homemade radio station located in his bedroom.  Those humble beginnings lead Carl to a real career in radio and on the air in Portland, Maine.  Through the years, Strube was a radio personality and eventually became a well respected industry consultant working with radio stations all over the United States.  When he wasn't in radio, Strube was in the music business and owned a record company that produced several worldwide chart-topping songs, including number one hits in the US and Europe.  Even with that outstanding success he never lost his love for radio and has come full circle as a partner in ownership of WNBP.\n\nThe other managing owner is Pete Falconi who is no stranger to the world of radio broadcasting.  Like Strube, Falconi began his career while still in high school and became a DJ on a local station near his home in Southborough, Mass.  After ten years as a popular Top 40 DJ in Boston, Pete moved into the management ranks of radio, first in Portland, Maine, then Portsmouth, Worcester and back to Boston.  Through the years Pete has gained the respect of radio industry leaders throughout the country and has won various awards and citations for radio programming and operations.  Just prior to his purchase of WNBP, Falconi was Program Director of an FM station for CBS Radio and led the station to a number one ranking in Boston.\n\nBoth Strube and Falconi believe that the best radio is local radio and are thrilled to be part of the WNBP team."

The board of trustees of SMU recognized and approved the organization on Jan 13, 1972. In the fall of 1974, WUSM upgraded its power and moved to its current location in the campus center. WUSM changed its call letters to WSMU January 15th, 1989. On June 10, 2006 WSMU moved from 91.1 FM to 89.3 FM and changed its call letters to WUMD. The new station/frequency operates at a licensed power of 9600 watts and broadcasts with state of the art HD technology. WUMD delivers CD-quality sound and provides the listener with the artist and song title on the display of their HD radios. WUMD will continue to web cast www.893wumd.org.\n\nWUMD, a non-profit educational radio station, acts as an outlet for ideas and forms of artistic expression which are not widely available in the WUMD broadcast area. In performing this function, the station provides exposure to musical genres and/or artists which are underrepresented by commercial media, with an emphasis on new music. WUMD also focuses on local music, featuring local bands/artist and local concert information. Information programming on WUMD addresses current issues relevant to the University and surrounding communities, with an emphasis on voices and viewpoints which are underrepresented in mainstream or commercial media coverage. WUMD produces 3 public affairs shows, airing weekly and the station also airs several independently produced programs. Like most radio stations on the non-commercial end of the dial, WUMD serves up a daring departure from the mainstream.\n\nWUMD provides a publicly accessible learning environment in which students and community residents can participate in order to gain knowledge and experience in various aspects of radio broadcasting. Individuals interested in volunteering at WUMD are invited to join our training classes, offered 3 times per year. Work study positions are also available."

Stellar visionaries from the College have made indelible marks on society, science, and health and wellness, including James Naismith's invention of basketball in 1891. From groundbreaking studies in exercise physiology to today's research in the new Center for Wellness Education and Research, Springfield College continues to transform lives and communities. \n\nA broad range of educational opportunities, both undergraduate and graduate, are offered at the main campus in Springfield, Mass., and at its 11 School of Human Services campuses around the country. Doctoral programs are offered in physical education and physical therapy. \n\nWith its foundation of academic excellence and rich athletic heritage, the College prepares students with real-world leadership skills for tomorrow's careers, including those in the health sciences, human and social services, sport management and movement studies, business, education, and the arts and sciences. Its low student-to-faculty ratio and experiential learning opportunities provide students with the skills they need to become leaders in a wide range of human-helping professions. \n\nSpringfield College graduates work in Fortune 500 companies, nonprofit organizations, public and private schools, hospitals, and health-care organizations. They are teachers and coaches, entrepreneurs, health care providers, YMCA leaders, and even gold-medal-winning Olympians. \n\nSpringfield College is ranked in the 2011 edition of “America's Best Colleges” in the top tier of “Best Universities—North Region” by the U.S.News Media Group. In addition, the College is designated as a premier leadership development center by the YMCA of the USA. \n\nRecognized by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and named to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for its exemplary community service programs, Springfield College students annually dedicate more than 150,000 hours of community service to schools and organizations in the city of Springfield. \n\nSpringfield College's campus offers an outstanding learning and living environment for students. Located in picturesque New England on 151 acres in the Pioneer Valley and situated on the shores of Lake Massasoit, Springfield College offers a vibrant campus culture that promotes a wide variety of activities and events for nearly every interest. \n\nNew facilities include a state-of-the-art Wellness and Recreation Complex, which received the 2009 Outstanding Sports Facilities Award from the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association. The College's new Richard B. Flynn Campus Union, opened in 2010, serves as the hub of campus life. These new facilities, and renovations to existing facilities, enrich the College's academic programs and create a superior campus experience for students. \n\nClassroom instruction, internships, and a wide range of volunteer programs provide students with the skills they need to succeed—and lead—in their careers and in their communities. The College's more than 47,608 alumni work in 60 nations. Wherever they work or reside, they become vital links in a human chain that makes a difference in the quality of people's lives and leads to impressive achievements. \n\nSpringfield College: Great Ideas, Great Careers, Great Leaders are Born Here!"
