Approximate population covered by our airborne signal is 100,000.\n\nMission\nThe task of this station is to provide the greater Bennington community with a voice for itself. The air space allotted to this station by the Federal Communications Commission is seen by us as a community resource with the potential to express and enhance the lives of the people of the community. \n\nWe will accomplish this mission by doing things that are creative, innovative, positively influential, and alive with music and laughter. The basic premises are that the community will listen to itself speaking; that the people of this area are interested in knowing about their neighbors; and that the region contains a whole world of compelling human issues and vital personalities. \n\nThe station aspires to be a voice of the community, so the subject of the station in essence must be the listener of the station. The one important thing that this station can provide and must provide is the voices and the stories of the people of the Bennington, adjacent New York, and Williamstown areas in person. \n\nWe may be able to demonstrate how a small local station can find a significant place in the midst of the mass media culture and make a positive difference in our local community. For this, we need your participation. Release your inner talent, share your interests with others, and host your own show.

Vermont Public Radio was made possible by thousands of Vermonters that volunteered and contributed funds to provide ongoing access to programming that informs, educates and entertains and we're still going strong. For the past decade, the station has consistently ranked as one of the most-listened-to public radio stations in the country, based on radio listening per capita. Currently, more than 26,000 people contribute to VPR. \n\nOn October 1, 2007 Vermont Public Radio became two distinct services - VPR and VPR Classical. VPR offers news and information programming along with public radio entertainment favorites. And VPR Classical, our expanded network of stations providing classical music 24/7. Vermont Public Radio's WVPR 89.5 FM in the Upper Valley became the first radio station in Vermont to begin broadcasting in HD digital sound on July 19, 2006. Fitting, given WVPR was Vermont's first public radio station. \n\nAs a community licensee, Vermont Public Radio operates with a state-wide Board of Directors and the majority of its funding comes from local community support.\n\n------\nShows: A Prairie Home Companion, All Things Considered, Car Talk (NPR), Fresh Air (NPR), Hearts of Space, Here and Now (WBUR), Living on Earth, Marketplace, NPR's Morning Edition, On the Media, Piano Jazz, Says You, Selected Shorts, This American Life, Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me, Weekend All Things Considered, Weekend Edition Saturday, Weekend Edition Sunday, From Our Own Correspondent (R4 Edition), Global Business, One Planet, The Strand, Assignment, BBC Business Daily, BBC World Business News, BBC World News, Business Weekly, Charlie Gillett's World of Music, Heart and Soul, On Point, Politics UK, Science in Action, The Instant Guide, The Interview, The World Today, World Briefing, World Update, BBC Newshour, The World, The Writer's Almanac, World Cafe, Marketplace Money, Speaking of Faith, Splendid Table, The Story, American Routes, Sound of Young America, Studio 360, Only a Game, All the Traditions, Jazz with George Thomas, My Place, Vermont Edition\n\n-----\nHosts: Michele Norris, Robert Siegel, Melissa Block, Tom Magliozzi, Ray Magliozzi, Robin Young, Steve Curwood, Bobby Bascomb, Eileen Bolinsky, Kai Ryssdal, Steve Chiotakis, Jeremy Hobson, Renee Montagne, Steve Inskeep, Dorothy Hickson, Carlos Rosado, Richard Knox, Isaiah Sheffer, Ira Glass, Jessica Hopper, Alex Blumberg, Peter Sagal Sagal, Carl Kasell Kasell, Guy Raz, Scott Simon, Audie Cornish, Tom Ashbrook, Dan Damon, Ahmed Omed Khpulwak, Jamie C Here, Lisa Mullins, Marco Werman, Garrison Keillor, Betsy Allister, Holly Vanderhaar, Dennis Coffey, Lloyd Cole, Steve Miller, Tess Vigeland, Lynne Rossetto Kasper, Sally Swift, Dick Gordon, Katie Davis, Carol Jackson, Nick Spitzer, Maureen Loughran, Kaori Maeyama, Paul Provenza, Kurt Andersen, Bill Littlefield, Charlie Pierce, Robert Resnik, Bill Moore, Carl Rohling, Thomas Hutchings, Joel Najman, Jane Lindholm, Bob Kinzel"
