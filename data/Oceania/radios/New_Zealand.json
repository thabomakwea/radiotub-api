It saves having to go from site to site to hunt for specific information of interest to most visitors - an important attribute.\nIt is a private sector, not public sector, website. Most other Bermuda websites operate on a 5-day week but it operates 7 days a week including public holidays.\nIt is the most comprehensive of all portal websites on Bermuda, with more than 120 in-depth separate but inter-linked websites in many different headings and topics. It is hugely more comprehensive than the Official Bermuda Government Tourism website. \nIt is strictly informatiol, not commercial, to ensure impartiality. Unlike most Bermuda sites, which focus on a specific service or product - or a variety of places only when they pay to be advertised - our information is solely from the noteworthy, quote worthy and newsworthy standpoints. There are no advertisements. In the few cases where recommendations are made, there are no \"kickbacks\" or commissions of any type.\nIt does not require fancy or specialized software to access. Anyone with any PC or Mac computer can do so, via any web browser.\nAll our files are origil and exclusive to us and intertiolly copyrighted. \nMore than 85 percent of all its 125 separate and comprehensive web files are deservedly positive about Bermuda. \nIt is linked to and by the independent The Royal Gazette daily newspaper, Bermuda's ONLY daily, which publishes more than 75% of all Bermuda's business, community, fincial, intertiol, real estate and tourism news."

It saves having to go from site to site to hunt for specific information of interest to most visitors - an important attribute.\nIt is a private sector, not public sector, website. Most other Bermuda websites operate on a 5-day week but it operates 7 days a week including public holidays.\nIt is the most comprehensive of all portal websites on Bermuda, with more than 120 in-depth separate but inter-linked websites in many different headings and topics. It is hugely more comprehensive than the Official Bermuda Government Tourism website. \nIt is strictly informatiol, not commercial, to ensure impartiality. Unlike most Bermuda sites, which focus on a specific service or product - or a variety of places only when they pay to be advertised - our information is solely from the noteworthy, quote worthy and newsworthy standpoints. There are no advertisements. In the few cases where recommendations are made, there are no \"kickbacks\" or commissions of any type.\nIt does not require fancy or specialized software to access. Anyone with any PC or Mac computer can do so, via any web browser.\nAll our files are origil and exclusive to us and intertiolly copyrighted. \nMore than 85 percent of all its 125 separate and comprehensive web files are deservedly positive about Bermuda. \nIt is linked to and by the independent The Royal Gazette daily newspaper, Bermuda's ONLY daily, which publishes more than 75% of all Bermuda's business, community, fincial, intertiol, real estate and tourism news. \nUpdated in part at least once daily and in operation since 1991, Bermuda Online provides comprehensive information about Bermuda  on The Royal Gazette's own website or official Bermuda Government's Tourism website run by the Department of Tourism. Both began long after Bermuda Online. The Official Bermuda Government website began five years later, in July 1996 (now at its Baltimore, MD, USA location). \n\nIt is still by far the biggest online repository of useful and continually updated information about the island."

Our programmes are made and broadcast by the community groups themselves (rather than by professiol broadcasters), and need not sound like what's produced anywhere else.

At the Hilltop the signal is broadcast back towards Akaroa.\nAkaroa FM is fully automated and uses Station Playlist Studio Software.

Human FM aims to provide a creative outlet for the student community of Victoria University, and in addition to provide a creative space for the wider Wellington community. Consequently the programming is as diverse as the talents and interests of such a large collective, and what they are capable of envisioning.\n\nWhen in full flight, Human FM will showcase many musical genres, with a special place for the live performance of local musicians and poets. As well as music, there will also be a range of lively, spoken-word programming. Robust debate and discussion will ensue on subjects of interest to the university and chaplaincy communities, including issues of eco-justice, local and world politics, theology and faith.\n\nHuman FM is a radio station not afraid to thrust itself into the grit and grind of human existence, while still maintaining a positive vibe. It provides a place for reflection and discussion, and a focal point for building community and developing relationships across the Victoria campus. We will refuse to play soulless music and will leave all cynicism to the current popular journalism that pollutes airwaves and newsstands across the western world.\n\nLast but not least, to eliminate compromise for all human beings involved in this project, Human FM remains a commercial free zone.\n\nPeace"
